#	Mockito 

-	Mockito is unit testing framework
-	Mockito can be used to create a mock service of an interface so that can be used to in unit testing
-	Mockito is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be used in unit testing


##	What is Mocking?

-	During unit testing of the application, sometimes it is not possible to replicate exact production environment. Sometimes database is not available and sometimes network access is not allowed. There can be many more such restrictions. To deal with such limitations, we have to create mock for these unavailable resources
-	Mocking is a way of testing the functionality of a class in isolation
-	Mocking does not require a database connection or properties file read or file server read to test a functionality
-	Mock objects do the mocking of the real service. A mock object returns a dummy data corresponding to some dummy input passed to it

##	Mockito Framework

-	Mockito framework facilitates in creating mock objects seamlessly
-	It uses Java Reflection in order to create mock objects for a given interface. Mock objects are nothing but proxy for actual implementations
-	Consider a case of Stock Service which returns the price details of a stock. During development, the actual stock service cannot be used to get real-time data. So we need a dummy implementation of the stock service. Mockito can do the same very easily, as its name suggests.


##	Test doubles

-	Mockito is an open source framework that allows you to easily create test doubles (mocks). Test Double is a generic term for any case where you replace a production object for testing purposes
-	In mockito, we generally work with following kind of test doubles.

	-	Fakes: 	Instead of hitting a real production DB, the test uses a simple collection/in-memory to store data

	-	Stubs – is an object that has predefined return values or responses to method executions made during the test
![](https://cdn.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/12/Stubs-1.jpeg)

	-	Spies – its actually the real function (dependency) call with some watching mechanism. Post the call, it can be verified whether the call was actually triggered or not along with the parameters
![](https://cdn.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/12/Spies.jpg)

	-	Mocks – Mocks are special instances of objects, on which Stubbed/pre-configured responses can be specified. The fact that the mock got called can be verified as an assert in the test.

	-	For Example:

		-	There is a report generator function which sends an email to a specified address during execution.

		-	As we don’t want to send actual email, again and again, during testing, the EmailService is mocked (and the email method which sends the email is configured to do nothing when it’s called). At the end of the test, we can just verify that the email sending method of the email service got called through the mocked object.

	
					@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
					public class ApplicationTest
					{
						@InjectMocks
						RecordService recordService;
						 
						@Mock
						DatabaseDAO databaseMock;
						 
						@Mock
						NetworkDAO networkMock;
						 
						@Test
						public void saveTest()
						{
							boolean saved = recordService.save("temp.txt");
							assertEquals(true, saved);
							 
							verify(databaseMock, times(1)).save("temp.txt");
							verify(networkMock, times(1)).save("temp.txt");
						}
					}
					
					
##	Benefits of Mockito

-	No Handwriting − No need to write mock objects on your own.
-	Return value support − Supports return values.
-	Exception support − Supports exceptions.
-	Order check support − Supports check on order of method calls.
-	Annotation support − Supports creating mocks using annotation.


##	Setting Up Simple Mockito Project

-	Spring Boot will use Mockito as default mocking Framework and adds its dependencies by default


##	Creating Mock Junit test cases


-	mock(class) is a method to create the Mock the passed class
-	when(Method) is used to return the mock data when that particular method is called
-	thenReturn() is used to return the value of method call
		
		
	-	Below is the example without mockito annotations:

				public class MockTest {

					@Test
					public void testGreatest() {
						DataService ds = mock(DataService.class);
						when(ds.retriveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[] {3,9,10});
						FindGreatest fg = new FindGreatest(ds);
						int greatest = fg.findGreatestOfAllNumbers();
						assertEquals(10, greatest);
						
						
					}
				}

##	Mocking Methods With Mockito				

-	We can mock methods with Mockito so that we can tell the mock how to behave when certain methods are called on it
-	We do this in each of the test methods.
- 	The following line of code tells the Mockito framework that we want the save() method of the mock DAO instance to return true when passed in a certain customer instance

			when(dao.save(customer)).thenReturn(true);

-	when is a static method of the Mockito class, and it returns an OngoingStubbing<T> (T is the return type of the method that we are mocking — in this case, it is boolean)

			OngoingStubbing<Boolean> stub = when(dao.save(customer));
			
-	The following are some of the methods that we can call on this stub

	-	thenReturn(returnValue)
	-	thenThrow(exception)
	-	thenCallRealMethod()
	-	thenAnswer()

		
##	Mockito Annotations @Mock @InjectMocks, @RunWith(MockitoJunitRunner.class)


-	@Mock:

	-	Instead of creating the mock instance of class manually
	-	we can use @Mock annotation to inject the mock of the class
	-	The @Mock annotation creates a mock implementation for the class it is annotated with.
	
-	@InjectMocks:

	-	@InjectMocks annotation is used to inject mock into  another class 
	-	Use preferably Constructor injection	
	-	@InjectMocks also creates the mock implementation, additionally injects the dependent mocks that are marked with the annotations @Mock into it.

-	@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)			
	
	-	This annotation is used Run the test class MockitoJunitRunner class

			
					@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
					public class MockTest {

						@Mock
						DataService ds;
						
						@InjectMocks
						FindGreatest fg;
						
						
						@Test
						public void testGreatest() {
							when(ds.retriveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[] {3,9,10});
							int greatest = fg.findGreatestOfAllNumbers();
							assertEquals(10, greatest);
							
							
						}
					}

-	@Spy:	
							
	-	Sometimes we need to call real methods of a dependency but still want to verify or track interactions with that dependency. This is where we would use a spy
	-	When a field is annotated with @Spy, Mockito will create a wrapper around an actual instance of that object and, therefore, we can call a real implementation and also verify interactions at the same time
	-	The @Spy annotation is used to create a real object and spy on that real object
	-	Some of the behavior of a spy could be mocked if needed.
	-	A spy helps to call all the real methods of the object while still tracking every interaction, just as we would with a mock

					public class CustomerServiceTestV2 {
					
					@Spy
					private CustomerDaoImpl daoSpy;
					
					@InjectMocks
					private CustomerService service;
					
					@Before
					public void setUp() throws Exception {
						MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);
					}
					
					@Test
					public void test() {
						Customer customer = new Customer();
						assertThat(service.addCustomer(customer), is(false));
						verify(daoSpy).save(any(Customer.class));
						verify(daoSpy, times(1)).exists(anyString());
						verify(daoSpy, never()).delete(any(Customer.class));
					}
				}

##	Difference between @Mock and @Spy

-	@Mock annotation will create dummy instance of class or interface
-	@Spy annotation will create actual instance of the class and spy on that instance
	-	Call on @Spy instance will call the original instance
	
		
##	Mocking List Interface


						package com.guru.bharath;

						import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
						import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
						import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

						import java.util.List;

						import org.junit.Test;
						import org.mockito.Mockito;

						public class ListMock {

							@Test
							public void listMock() {
								List list = mock(List.class);
								when(list.size()).thenReturn(10).thenReturn(20);
								
								System.out.println(list.size());
								
								assertEquals(20, list.size());
							}
							
							@Test
							public void test_listGet() {
								List list = mock(List.class);
								when(list.get(0)).thenReturn("Guru");
								
								System.out.println(list.get(0));
								
								assertEquals(null, list.get(1));
								assertEquals("Guru", list.get(0));
							}
							
							
							@Test
							public void test_MockitoAny() {
								List list = mock(List.class);
								when(list.get(Mockito.anyInt())).thenReturn("Guru");
								
								System.out.println(list.get(0));
								
								assertEquals(null, list.get(1));
								assertEquals("Guru1", list.get(0));
							}
							
						}

##	Mockito - Adding Behavior

-	Mockito adds a functionality to a mock object using the methods when()

			@Test
			public void listMock() {
				List list = mock(List.class);
				when(list.size()).thenReturn(10).thenReturn(20);
				
				System.out.println(list.size());
				
				assertEquals(20, list.size());
			}
			
##	Mockito - Verifying Behavior


-	Mockito can ensure whether a mock method is being called with reequired arguments or not.
- 	It is done using the verify() method. Take a look at the following code snippet

			@Test
			   public void testAdd(){
				  //add the behavior of calc service to add two numbers
				  when(calcService.add(10.0,20.0)).thenReturn(30.00);
					
				  //test the add functionality
				  Assert.assertEquals(calcService.add(10.0, 20.0),30.0,0);
				   
				  //verify the behavior
				  verify(calcService).add(10.0, 20.0);
			   }
			}


##	Mockito - Exception Handling

-	Mockito provides the capability to a mock to throw exceptions, so exception handling can be tested
-	Here we've added an exception clause to a mock object. MathApplication makes use of calcService using its add method and the mock throws a RuntimeException whenever calcService.add() method is invoked


			@Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)
		   public void testAdd(){
			  //add the behavior to throw exception
			  doThrow(new RuntimeException("Add operation not implemented"))
				 .when(calcService).add(10.0,20.0);

			  //test the add functionality
			  Assert.assertEquals(mathApplication.add(10.0, 20.0),30.0,0); 
		   }
		   
		   
##	Mockito - Spying

-	Mockito provides option to create spy on real objects. When spy is called, then actual method of real object is called.

			@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
			public class MathApplicationTester {
				
			   private MathApplication mathApplication;
			   private CalculatorService calcService;

			   @Before
			   public void setUp(){
				  mathApplication = new MathApplication();
				  Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
				  calcService = spy(calculator);
				  mathApplication.setCalculatorService(calcService);	     
			   }

			   @Test
			   public void testAdd(){

				  //perform operation on real object
				  //test the add functionality
				  Assert.assertEquals(mathApplication.add(20.0, 10.0),30.0,0);
			   }
			}
			
##	Mockito - Resetting Mock

-	Mockito provides the capability to a reset a mock so that it can be reused later. Take a look at the following code snippet.

			
				@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
				public class MathApplicationTester {
					
				   private MathApplication mathApplication;
				   private CalculatorService calcService;

				   @Before
				   public void setUp(){
					  mathApplication = new MathApplication();
					  calcService = mock(CalculatorService.class);
					  mathApplication.setCalculatorService(calcService);
				   }

				   @Test
				   public void testAddAndSubtract(){

					  //add the behavior to add numbers
					  when(calcService.add(20.0,10.0)).thenReturn(30.0);
				  
					  //test the add functionality
					  Assert.assertEquals(mathApplication.add(20.0, 10.0),30.0,0);

					  //reset the mock	  
					  reset(calcService);

					  //test the add functionality after resetting the mock
					  Assert.assertEquals(mathApplication.add(20.0, 10.0),30.0,0);   
				   }
				}

##	Mockito - Timeouts

-	Mockito provides a special Timeout option to test if a method is called within stipulated time frame.

				@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
				public class MathApplicationTester {
					
					   private MathApplication mathApplication;
					   private CalculatorService calcService;

					   @Before
					   public void setUp(){
						  mathApplication = new MathApplication();
						  calcService = mock(CalculatorService.class);
						  mathApplication.setCalculatorService(calcService);
					   }
					   
					   @Test
					   public void testAddAndSubtract(){

						  //add the behavior to add numbers
						  when(calcService.add(20.0,10.0)).thenReturn(30.0);

						  //subtract the behavior to subtract numbers
						  when(calcService.subtract(20.0,10.0)).thenReturn(10.0);

						  //test the subtract functionality
						  Assert.assertEquals(mathApplication.subtract(20.0, 10.0),10.0,0);

						  //test the add functionality
						  Assert.assertEquals(mathApplication.add(20.0, 10.0),30.0,0);

						  //verify call to add method to be completed within 100 ms
						  verify(calcService, timeout(100)).add(20.0,10.0);
						  
						  //invocation count can be added to ensure multiplication invocations
						  //can be checked within given timeframe
						  verify(calcService, timeout(100).times(1)).subtract(20.0,10.0);
					   }
				   
				  }
