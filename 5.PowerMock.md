#	Mock Testing using PowerMock 

-	PowerMock is an open source mocking library for the Java world
-	It extends the existing mocking frameworks, such as EasyMock and Mockito, to add even more powerful features to them
- 	PowerMock enables us to write good unit tests for even the most untestable code
- 	Most of the mocking frameworks in Java cannot mock static methods or final classes
-	But using PowerMock, we can mock almost any class

##	Participant Classes

-	Employee.java


			public class Employee {
				private String fName;
			 
				public String getfName() {
					return fName;
				}
			 
				public void setfName(String fName) {
					this.fName = fName;
				}
			}		
	
-	EmployeeService.java

	
			
			public class EmployeeService
			{
				public int getEmployeeCount() {
					throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
				}
				 
				public void saveEmployee(Employee employee) {
					//return nothing
				}
			}
			
-	EmployeeController.java


			
			public class EmployeeController
			{
				private EmployeeService employeeService;
			 
				public EmployeeController(EmployeeService employeeService) {
					this.employeeService = employeeService;
				}
			 
				public int getProjectedEmployeeCount()
				{
					final int actualEmployeeCount = employeeService.getEmployeeCount();
					return actualEmployeeCount * 2;
				}
				 
				public void saveEmployee(Employee employee) {
					employeeService.saveEmployee(employee);
				}
			}
			
			
			
##	First Test without PowerMock

			@Test
			public void shouldGetCountOfEmployees()
			{
				EmployeeController employeeController =new EmployeeController(new EmployeeService());
				Assert.assertEquals(10,employeeController.getProjectedEmployeeCount());
			}
			
-	Throws Exception

			java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
			
			
##	Mock a simple method using PowerMock
			
			
			@Test
			public void firstMockTest()
			{
				//Creating a mock using the PowerMockito.mock
				//method for the EmployeeService class.
				EmployeeService mock =PowerMockito.mock(EmployeeService.class);
			 
				//Next statement essentially says that when getProjectedEmployeeCount method
				//is called on the mocked EmployeeService instance, return 8.
				PowerMockito.when(mock.getEmployeeCount()).thenReturn(8);
			 
				EmployeeController employeeController = new EmployeeController(mock);
				 
				Assert.assertEquals(16, employeeController.getProjectedEmployeeCount());
			}
			

##	Verify if mock method was really invoked?
	
			
-	Sometimes, unit test only need to call a method and forget it. Mostly because method does not return any value. You can certainly test whether value is present in DB by fetching it again from data source. 
-	But if your test only require to validate that a method was called and thatâ€™s it, the you can do it as well using powermock.


				@Test
				public void verifyMethodInvokationTest()
				{
					EmployeeService mock =PowerMockito.mock(EmployeeService.class);
					EmployeeController employeeController = new EmployeeController(mock);
				 
					Employee employee = new Employee();
					employeeController.saveEmployee(employee);
				 
					//Verifying that controller did call the
					//saveEmployee() method on the mocked service instance.
					Mockito.verify(mock).saveEmployee(employee);
				}
				
				
-	In above test example, using verify(mock) method, we are verifying the saveEmployee(employee) was invoked indeed. If you run above test, this will pass.
-	To verify that above code is working perfectly, comment out below line from EmployeeController.java.

				public void saveEmployee(Employee employee) {
					//employeeService.saveEmployee(employee); //Comment this line
				}
				
-	run the test again, it will fail with this error

				Wanted but not invoked:
				employeeService.saveEmployee(
					com.bharath.powermock.examples.model.Employee@7808b9
				);
				-> at com.bharath.powermock.examples.test.EmployeeControllerTestOne.verifyMethodInvokationTest(EmployeeControllerTestOne.java:47)
				Actually, there were zero interactions with this mock.
