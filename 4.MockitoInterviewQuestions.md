#	Why do we need mocking?

-	The component under test have dependencies which are not yet implemented or the implementation is in progress
	-	A good example can be a REST API endpoint which will be available later at some point of time, but you have consumed it in the code via a dependency.
	-	Now as the real implementation is still not available,  you really know most of the times what is the expected response of that API. Mocks allow you to test those kinds of integration.
	-	Camel Endpoints
	
	
-	Component updates the state in the system
	
	-	DB calls – you would not want to update your DB with data that is just for testing purposes. 
	-	This might result in corrupting the data, moreover, the availability of DB is another challenge when the test is executed
	
	
##	Difference between doReturn and thenReturn

-	Mockito provides two different syntax for creating stubs like:


	-	doReturn and thenReturn
	-	doNothing (no thenNothing)
	-	doThrow and thenThrow
	
	
-	So how does both of these differ?

	-	The thenReturn way of stubbing is a type-safe way of setting up stubs. 
	-	What this essentially means is that it does a compile-time check against the return types that you want to stub too
	
##	When and why should a spy be used?

-	Spy is a type of partial mock supported by Mockito.
-	a) When no mock is setup , any interaction on spy results in calling the real methods. But it still allows you to verify the interactions with the spied object like – was a method actually called, how many times the method was called, what were the arguments using which the method was called etc.
-	b) It gives you the flexibility to set up partial mocks.
	
	-	For Example, if you have an object with 2 methods – method1 and method2 and you want method1 to be called and method2 to be mocked. Spies provide this kind of setup
	-	Report generating and Email Testing
	
##	Why can’t static methods be mocked using Mockito?

-	Static methods are associated with the class itself and not any particular instance of the class. This means that all instances/objects of the class use the same instance of the static method.

-	Static methods are more like procedural code and are mostly used in legacy systems in general.
	
-	Mock libraries typically create mocks by dynamical instance creation at runtime, either through interfaces or through inheritance and as the static method is not associated with any particular instance it’s not possible for mocking frameworks (like mockito, easy mock etc) to mock Static methods.
	
-	Frameworks like PowerMock which do have support for static methods perform bytecode manipulation at runtime in order to mock static methods.

##	 What’s the need to verify that the mock was called?

-	Setting up a stub on a mocked object (or a spied instance) does not guarantee whether the stubbed setup was even invoked.

-	“verification” matchers, give a facility to validate whether the stub that was set up was actually invoked or not, how many times was the call made, what arguments were the stubbed method called with etc.

##	What is good testable code?

-	Reduced no of dependencies or tight coupling – Example: Dependencies should be injected rather than instantiated directly
-	Less / Minimal usage of static methods and final classes – These generally indicate code smells and were mostly associated with the legacy code


##	What are the limitations of Mockito?

-	Its inability to mock static methods.
-	Constructors, private methods and final classes cannot be mocked.


##	Which frameworks can support mocking Private and Static methods?

-	Frameworks like PowerMockito (which are essentially extensions of Mockito framework), JMockit etc. do provide means to mock private and static methods

##	Mocking/Stubbing default methods in Interface in Java 8.

-	With Java 8’s implementation of default methods in Interface, Mockito provides out of box support to mock such default methods. (Please note that this support was introduced from Mockito 2 onwards).

-	These methods can be mocked/stubbed like any other methods of a class or interface.


##	 Returning multiple values against consecutive method calls


-	Using comma separated: This works with thenReturn.
	
			when(mockDatabaseImpl.getGrade(anyInt())).thenReturn("A","B", "C");
			
	-	This means that when getGrade methods get called in the method under test, the first invocation will return “A”, the second invocation will return “B” and so on
	

-	Consecutive thenReturn: This is an approach that is chained with thenReturn statements. Applying chained calls to the same example will look as shown below.


			when(mockDatabaseImpl.getGrade(anyInt())).thenReturn("A").thenReturn("B").thenReturn("C");

-	Consecutive doReturn: The last approach is using doReturn in the chained format as above.

			doReturn("A").doReturn("B").doReturn("C").when(mockDatabaseImpl).getGrade(anyInt())


##	What are the different types of mocking frameworks and how do they work?

-	There are broadly 2 categories of mocking frameworks:

			Proxy-based – E.g. Mockito, EasyMock etc.
			Bytecode based – E.g. PowerMock, JMockit etc.
