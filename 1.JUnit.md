# Unit Testing

-	Unit Testing is testing is testing the specific functionality
-	For example: Testing method1, method2, method3 of class


		
		class Class1 {
		
			
			method1()
			method2()
			method3();
		
		
		}
		
		
## JUnit

-	Junit is a framework that helps to perform unit testing
-	Jnuit help to test the particular method and test whether we are getting expected output
-	For example:

	-	Call the method with particular params and test whether we are getting expected output
	
		square(3) == 9
		square(4) == 16

##	Automation Testing

-	JUnit test are Automated test 
-	JUnit test are part of Continuous Integration
-	JUnit test cases will gets executed as part of Build process
-	When ever the code changes and test fails for some reason then  we will gets a notification
-	Or We can also run the test cases automatically on a specific timings


##	Assert Methods


-	assertEquals(excepted, actualResult)
-	assertNotEquals(excepted, actualResult)
-	assertNull()
-	assertNotNull()
-	assertFalse(condition)
-	assertTrue(condition)	
-	assertArrayEquals(excepted, actualResult)
-	fail()

##	Identical Assert Methods

-	assertSame(expected, actual), It will return true if expected == actual
-	assertNotSame(expected, actual)


##	Important JUnit Annotations

-	Order is not guaranteed in Junit test case execution


-	@Test
-	@After - Will executed for every method
-	@Before - 	Will executed for every method
-	@BeforeClass - Executed only once per class
-	@AfterClass -  Executed only once per class
	-	Should be static methods
	-	Class level methods
	
	
##	Additional Junit Annotations

-	@Test(timeout=500) : This annotation can be used if you want to set some timeout during test execution for e.g. if you are working under some SLA (Service level agreement), and tests need to be completed within some specified time

-	@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)	: This annotation can be used if you want to handle some exception during test execution. For, e.g., if you want to check whether a particular method is throwing specified exception or not

-	@Ignores	: 	If you want to ignore a test method, use @Ignore along with @Test annotation. If you want to ignore all the tests of class, use @Ignore annotation at the class level


##	JUnit Test Suite

-	Test suite allows us to aggregate all test cases from multiple classes in one place and run it together
-	To run the suite test, you need to annotate a class using below-mentioned annotations:

			@Runwith(Suite.class)
			@SuiteClasses(test1.class,test2.class……) or
			@Suite.SuiteClasses ({test1.class, test2.class……})




##	JUnit Parameterized Test 

-	Parameterized test is to execute the same test over and over again using different values
-	It helps developer to save time in executing same test which differs only in their inputs and expected results
-	Using Parameterized test, one can set up a test method that retrieves data from some data source



##	TestNG Vs JUnit

-	Both Testng and Junit are Testing framework used for Unit Testing
-	TestNG is similar to JUnit.
-	Few more functionalities are added to it that makes TestNG more powerful than JUnit

##	Run test in a particular order
			
			@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING)
			public class ExecutionOrderTest {

				@Test
				public void testB() {
					assertThat(1 + 1, is(2));
				}

				@Test
				public void test1() {
					assertThat(1 + 1, is(2));
				}

				@Test
				public void testA() {
					assertThat(1 + 1, is(2));
				}

				@Test
				public void test2() {
					assertThat(1 + 1, is(2));
				}

				@Test
				public void testC() {
					assertThat(1 + 1, is(2));
				}

			}


##	JUnit + Spring integration

			@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
			@ContextConfiguration(classes = {AppConfig.class})
			public class MachineLearningTest {

				//DI
				@Autowired
				@Qualifier("ml")
				DataModelService ml;

				@Test
				public void test_ml_always_return_true() {

					//assert correct type/impl
					assertThat(ml, instanceOf(MachineLearningService.class));

					//assert true
					assertThat(ml.isValid(""), is(true));

				}
			}
