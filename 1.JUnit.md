# Unit Testing

-	Unit Testing is testing is testing the specific functionality
-	For example: Testing method1, method2, method3 of class


		
		class Class1 {
		
			
			method1()
			method2()
			method3();
		
		
		}
		
		
## JUnit

-	Junit is a framework that helps to perform unit testing
-	Jnuit help to test the particular method and test whether we are getting expected output
-	For example:

	-	Call the method with particular params and test whether we are getting expected output
	
		square(3) == 9
		square(4) == 16

##	Automation Testing

-	JUnit test are Automated test 
-	JUnit test are part of Continuous Integration
-	JUnit test cases will gets executed as part of Build process
-	When ever the code changes and test fails for some reason then  we will gets a notification
-	Or We can also run the test cases automatically on a specific timings


##	Assert Methods


-	assertEquals(excepted, actualResult)
-	assertNotEquals(excepted, actualResult)
-	assertNull()
-	assertNotNull()
-	assertFalse(condition)
-	assertTrue(condition)	
-	assertArrayEquals(excepted, actualResult)



##	Important JUnit Annotations

-	Order is not guaranteed 


-	@Test
-	@After - Will executed for every method
-	@Before - 	Will executed for every method
-	@BeforeClass - Executed only once per class
-	@AfterClass -  Executed only once per class
	-	Should be static methods
	-	Class level methods
