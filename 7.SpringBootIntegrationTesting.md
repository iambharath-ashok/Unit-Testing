# Spring Boot Integration Test

-	For doing integration testing, we need to have spring boot app up and running fine, so that we can make realtime request from unit testing methods
-	We can use Rest template to make different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT along with headers
-	The goal of Integration test is to go across all the layers
-	In integration test, we will realtime time API call and db call to fetch the data from backend
-	In an Unit Test, we just test a unit like either controller, service or Dao part
-	In order to write test cases for unit testing or integration test we need add spring-boot-starter-test dependency
-	Test scope dependency will be part while testing the application, will not be part of production code and war
-	Test files will not be part of production code


##	Setting up Spring Boot Integration Test

-	Initialize and launch Spring boot Application
-	Add @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) and @SpringBootTest(classes=Application.class, webEnviroment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM)
-	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	- 	This annotation will launch the Spring Boot application or Spring  Context
-	@SpringBootTest(classes=Application.class, webEnviroment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM)
	-	For this annotation we need to pass the SpringBoot Application main class to launch the spring boot application
	-	Since @SpringBootTest launch Spring Boot application for this test, we need to use the RANDOM port 
	-	In integration server, there may be multiple different servers, RANDOM port will assign some different port for this integration test
	-	RANDOM port helps to overcome the problem with hard-coded port 
	
-	@LocalServerPort
	-	This annotation is used to inject the RANDOM port created to make the API call to API
	
			@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
			@SpringBootTest(classes = Application.class,
					webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
			public class SurveyControllerIT {

				@LocalServerPort
				private int port;

			}	
	
	
##	Launching Spring Boot Integration Test	


-	Create a test method or test case with @Test annotation on top of method
-	Use TestRestTemplate to invoke the API endpoint with required headers using HttpEntity instance 
-	TestRestTemplate is similar to RestTemplate expect that TestRestTemplate will used while test case execution

	
				@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
				@SpringBootTest(classes = Application.class,
						webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
				public class SurveyControllerIT {

					@LocalServerPort
					private int port;

					@Test
					public void testRetrieveSurveyQuestion() {

						String url = "http://localhost:" + port
								+ "/surveys/Survey1/questions/Question1";

						TestRestTemplate restTemplate = new TestRestTemplate();

						HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();

						headers.setAccept(Arrays.asList(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON));

						HttpEntity<String> entity = new HttpEntity<String>(null, headers);

						ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.exchange(url,
								HttpMethod.GET, entity, String.class);

						String expected = "{id:Question1,description:Largest Country in the World,correctAnswer:Russia}";

						JSONAssert.assertEquals(expected, response.getBody(), false);
					}
				}

	
	
	
	-	exchange() method of restTemplate is used to pass the HttpEntity and headers as part of request
	-	HttpEntity instance will be used to set the headers
	-	HttpHeaders headers is used to set the headers 
	-	JSONAssert is used to do comparison of expected and actual json response
	-	response.getBody() on ResponseEntity will return the response of API call
	

	
	
## Testing list as API response

				   @Test
					public void retrieveSurveyQuestions() throws Exception {
						ResponseEntity<List<Question>> response = template.exchange(
								createUrl("/surveys/Survey1/questions/"), HttpMethod.GET,
								new HttpEntity<String>("DUMMY_DOESNT_MATTER", headers),
								new ParameterizedTypeReference<List<Question>>() {
								});

						Question sampleQuestion = new Question("Question1",
								"Largest Country in the World", "Russia", Arrays.asList(
										"India", "Russia", "United States", "China"));

						assertTrue(response.getBody().contains(sampleQuestion));
					}

		
##	Adding Integration Test for POST Request

-	Change method from GET to POST
-	Assign Request body in the HttpEntity
-	assert the response body


					@Test
					public void createSurveyQuestion() throws Exception {
						Question question = new Question("DOESN'T MATTER", "Smallest Number",
								"1", Arrays.asList("1", "2", "3", "4"));

						ResponseEntity<String> response = template.exchange(
								createUrl("/surveys/Survey1/questions/"), HttpMethod.POST,
								new HttpEntity<Question>(question, headers), String.class);

						assertThat(response.getHeaders().get(HttpHeaders.LOCATION).get(0),
								containsString("/surveys/Survey1/questions/"));
					}
