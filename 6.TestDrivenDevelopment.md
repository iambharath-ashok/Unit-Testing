#	What is Test Driven Development


-	TDD  is a programming practice that instruct developers to write new code only if automated test are failing 
-	Initially code will be in failing case
-	Primary goal of TDD is to make sure that source code is bug free and throughly tested at confirmatory level and to achieve 100 code coverage

###	TDD Vs. Traditional Testing

-	TDD approach is primarily a specification technique. It ensures that your source code is thoroughly tested at confirmatory level.
	
	-	With traditional testing, a successful test finds one or more defects
	-	With TDD we can identify bugs at very early stage
	-	In TDD more focus is on production code that verifies whether testing will work properly. In traditional testing, more focus is on test case design
	-	In TDD, we can achieve 100% coverage test. Every single line of code is tested, unlike traditional testing
	-	In Agile Modeling (AM), we should "test with a purpose". we should know why we are testing something and what level its need to be tested

##	How to perform TDD Test

-	Add a test
-	Execute all tests and see if any new test fails
-	Make changes to code (Refactoring)
-	Execute tests again
-	Repeat

###	TDD cycle defines

-	Write a test
-	Make it run.
-	Change the code to make it right i.e. Refactor.
-	Repeat process.

###	Some clarifications about TDD:

-	TDD is neither about "Testing" nor about "Design".
-	TDD does not mean "write some of the tests, then build a system that passes the tests.
-	TDD does not mean "do lots of Testing."	


##	Advantages of TDD

-	Early bug detection
-	100% coverage
-	Better Designed, cleaner and well extensible code

-	Good for teamwork
	-	In the absence of any team member, other team members can easily pick up and work on the code. It also aids knowledge sharing, thereby making the team more effective overall.

-	Good for Developers
	-	Though developers have to spend more time in writing TDD test cases, it takes a lot less time for debugging and developing new features. You will write cleaner, less complicated code.

	
	
##	What is acceptance TDD and Developer TDD

-	Acceptance TDD (ATDD):
	-	With ATDD you write a single acceptance test
	-	This test fulfills the requirement of the specification or satisfies the behavior of the system
	-	After that write just enough production/functionality code to fulfill that acceptance test
	-	Acceptance test focuses on the overall behavior of the system. ATDD also was known as Behavioral Driven Development (BDD)
	
	
-	Developer TDD:
	-	With Developer TDD you write single developer test i.e. unit test and then just enough production code to fulfill that test
	-	The unit test focuses on every small functionality of the system. Developer TDD is simply called as TDD

##	Agile Model Driven Development


-	Iteration 0: Envisioning:
	-	Initial requirements envisioning
	-	Initial Architectural envisioning

-	Iteration modeling:

	-	Here team must plan the work that will be done for each iteration.

	-	Agile process is used for each iteration, i.e. during each iteration, new work item will be added with priority.
	-	First higher prioritized work will be taken into consideration. Work items added may be reprioritized or removed from items stack any time.
	-	The team discusses how they are going to implement each requirement. Modeling is used for this purpose.
	-	Modeling analysis and design is done for each requirement which is going to implement for that iteration.
	
-	Test Driven Development (TDD):

	-	Developers does Test Driven Development

##	Test Driven Development (TDD) Vs. Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD)


TDD	| AMDD
----|----
TDD is detailed specification | AMDD works for bigger issues
TDD promotes the development of high-quality code |	AMDD promotes high-quality communication with stakeholders and developers.
TDD speaks to programmers | AMDD talks to business analyst, stakeholders, and data professionals.
TDD has limited scope to software works | AMDD has a broad scope including stakeholders. It involves working towards a common understanding
